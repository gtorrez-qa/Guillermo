# QA Automation Portfolio

## 👋 About Me
I am a QA Engineer focused on quality-driven testing strategies, combining **manual testing**, **automation**, and **CI/CD validation** to ensure reliable and scalable software delivery.

I have hands-on experience working with modern testing tools and applying **risk-based testing** principles to prioritize critical user flows.

---

## 🧠 Testing Philosophy
I believe that quality is not about testing everything, but about **testing what matters most**.

My testing approach is based on:
- Risk-based testing
- Business impact analysis
- Early validation in CI/CD pipelines
- Continuous improvement

## 🔍 Risk-Based Testing Strategy

| Area | Risk Level | Impact | Testing Strategy |
|------|-----------|--------|------------------|
| Authentication | High | User access blocked | E2E + Regression |
| Payments / Wallet | Critical | Financial loss | E2E + API testing |
| Registration | Medium | Onboarding failure | Functional + Regression |
| Navigation | Medium | Broken user flow | Smoke testing |
| UI / Styling | Low | Visual issues | Exploratory testing |
